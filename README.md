Beam time is a logic puzzle game where you redirect and split laser beams to create digital circuits. Through the campaign, you will explore logic gates, oscillators, latches, counters, adders, memory, and more.
Each level provides a description and some test cases your solution must pass.
Inputs are passed in through laser emitters and outputs are made with beam detectors.
It's your job to use some combination of mirrors, beam splitters, delay gates, and galvos to complete the level. Galvos are the only 'active' component, they rotate the mirror they are facing when powered.

Here are all seven in-game components from left to right: emitter, galvo (rotates the mirror itâ€™s facing when powered with a beam), splitter, mirror, delay, wall, detector. With just these few components, It's possible to perform any computation.

The game also features a sandbox mode where you can build whatever you want.
Below is an implementation of the one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton [Rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30).
In the future I want to build a programmable computer within the sandbox.
