# Beam Time

Beam time is a logic puzzle about redirecting and splitting laser beams to create circuits.
I'm making a custom GPU accelerated game engine for this, because why not, so this will probably take a while to finish.

Here is an example solution for the XOR level.
Note that this project is still very unfinished.

Below are all the components in the game. From left to right: the emitter, galvo (rotates the mirror itâ€™s facing when powered with a beam), splitter, mirror, delay, wall, and detector.
