Beam time is a logic puzzle about redirecting and splitting laser beams to create circuits.
I'm making a custom GPU accelerated game engine for this, because why not, so this will probably take a while to finish.

Here is an example of an XOR gate implemented in game with some and, or, and nand gates.
