# Beam Time

Beam time is a logic puzzle where you redirect and split laser beams to create digital circuits.
It's still very unfinished, but I plan to publish it on steam when completed.
Its made with a custom GPU accelerated game engine, just because why not.

Here is an example solution for the XOR level.
This screen recording is a bit out of date, but I don't feel like retaking it.

Below are all the components in the game. From left to right: the emitter, galvo (rotates the mirror itâ€™s facing when powered with a beam), splitter, mirror, delay, wall, and detector.

The game also features a sandbox mode where you can build whatever you want.
Below is an implementation of the one-dimensional elementary cellular automaton [Rule 30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30).
In the future I want to build a programmable computer within the sandbox.
