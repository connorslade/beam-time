        In addition to logic gates (AND, OR, NOT) there is another category of circuits you can make: oscillators! These are just circuits that periodically emit a pulse.
        
        For this level, make the output alternate between the on and off states every four ticks, for a total cycle period of eight ticks.
        
        Instead of using P to start the simulation, use SPACE to step through each simulation tick one at a time.",
